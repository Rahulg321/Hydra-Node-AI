      <h3 className="mt-4">Account Registration and Usage Guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        To access HydraNode&apos;s services, users must create an account,
        ensuring that all information provided is accurate and updated when
        necessary. Users are fully responsible for all activities conducted
        under their accounts and are expected to maintain the confidentiality of
        their credentials. If unauthorised access to an account occurs, it is
        imperative that users notify HydraNode immediately. While we strive to
        secure our platform, HydraNode is not liable for any loss or damage
        resulting from a failure to safeguard account information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users must not share their account credentials with unauthorised
        individuals and are expected to uphold HydraNode&apos;s community
        standards by maintaining a respectful and secure learning environment.
        This includes refraining from sharing answers or seeking unauthorised
        assistance during practice or mock exams, attempting to manipulate AI
        systems to gain an unfair advantage, and violating any applicable local,
        national, or international laws. These guidelines ensure that all users
        can learn and develop their skills in a productive and fair environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        HydraNode reserves the right to suspend or terminate any accounts
        violating these guidelines or involved in behaviour detrimental to the
        community. Additionally, users must only use their accounts for personal
        learning and must not exploit our services for commercial purposes
        without explicit authorisation.
      </p>
      <h3>Payment and Billing</h3>
      <p>
        When purchasing HydraNode&apos;s services, you must provide accurate and
        up-to-date financial information relevant to your chosen payment method,
        which may include credit card details. Payments are processed through a
        secure third-party provider, Stripe, which manages all financial
        transactions per its own Terms of Service. HydraNode does not process or
        retain any of your financial information directly. By using our
        platform, you agree to comply with Stripe&apos;s Terms of Service, which
        govern the handling and security of your payment information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subscription payments must be made in advance, either monthly or
        annually, based on your chosen plan. Subscription fees are
        non-refundable except where required by local regulations. Users can
        cancel their subscriptions at any time, and their plan will remain
        active until the end of the current billing period. It&apos;s your
        responsibility to manage subscription settings and ensure timely
        payments to prevent service interruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend that users periodically review their billing details to
        confirm their payment method remains accurate and updated. In cases of
        declined payments or insufficient funds, HydraNode reserves the right to
        suspend or terminate service access until payment issues are resolved.
        Users will receive notifications regarding billing status, and if
        assistance is needed, our customer support team is available to provide
        guidance.
